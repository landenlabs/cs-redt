C# Application to remove empty directories. 
This app was started with code was a program written by Jonas David John ( http://www.jonasjohn.de/). 
I modified the program to fix a few bugs, add stats to the legend, add additional menu picks and add the List view tab.

### Features include:
 * Define which files maybe present in empty directory
 * Mark directories to permanently ignore or temporarily ignore
 * View empty directories as Tree or List view.
 * Delete All, Branch or selected directories.
